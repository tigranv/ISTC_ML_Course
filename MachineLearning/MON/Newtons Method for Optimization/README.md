# Purpose
The jupyter note book "Newtons Method.ipynb" implements Newton's method from scratch to estimate the parameters in a simple linear regression by minimizing the sum of square error (SSE). The notebook contains the mathematical details of the Newton's method and shows implementation in python. 

# Data set
I use the [IMDB movie data set from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset) and examine the relationship between IMDB rating and gross sales revenue using a simple linear regression model. For analysis purposes I clean the data set to only contain IMDB movie rating and gross sales revenue for US movies.
