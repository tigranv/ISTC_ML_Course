## Introduction
The notebook "Principal Component Analysis.ipynb" introduces the theory, and intuition behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. It applies PCA to visualize a 8-dimensional data set onto 2D and 3D scatter plots. 

## Data
The data used for the application of PCA can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) on kaggle. This data contains the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, body mass index (BMI), age, and a diabetes pedigree (measure of the likelihood of getting diabities based on their ancestor's history) on several women over the age of 21 from Pima indian heritage. The data set contains labels on whether a women in the data tested positive for diabities. 

## Dependencies
* numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

All dependencies can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
