## Purpose
The notebook "Regularization in Linear Regression.ipynb" discusses L1 and L2 regularization methods in the context of linear regression. The benefits of regularization to prevent overfitting and implementation in python using real data are included.

## Data
I use the IMDB movie data set from kaggle and examine the relationship between IMDB rating and gross sales revenue using a simple linear regression model (degree 1), multiple linear regression (degree 5), and ridge regression (degree 5 with L2 loss function). For analysis purposes I clean the data set to only contain IMDB movie rating and gross sales revenue for US movies.

## Dependencies
* numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

All dependencies can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
